eskimo v0.1rv1 (alpha)
===
eskimo is considered abandoned as of December 27, 2019. feel free to do whatever you want with it. i may 
do minor commits here and there, but this project is, for the most part, deprecated.

eskimo is not necessarily a package manager itself, but a manager of package managers.
the goal of eskimo is to take package managers like "apt", "zypper", "dnf", "pacman", etc. and
group them all together under one roof.
===
so basically, instead of having to use different package managers across different distros,
eskimo takes care of all of that translating for you, so you only have to deal with one dialect,
and it's pretty simple.

requirements:

- python (>= 3.4.6, recommend 3.7)
  - python3-pip (>=19.0.3, recommend 19.1.1)
    - pyinstaller (3.4)

current package manager support:

- apt/dpkg
- zypper
- pacman
- dnf
