eskimo v0.0.1 (development pre-alpha)
===
eskimo is not necessarily a package manager itself, but a manager of package managers.
the goal of eskimo is to take package managers like "apt", "zypper", "dnf", "pacman", etc. and
group them all together under one roof.

more on this when I get somewhere with it, probably later today.
