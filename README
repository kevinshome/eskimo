eskimo v0.0.2 (development pre-alpha)
===
eskimo is not necessarily a package manager itself, but a manager of package managers.
the goal of eskimo is to take package managers like "apt", "zypper", "dnf", "pacman", etc. and
group them all together under one roof.
===
so basically, instead of having to use different package managers across different distros,
eskimo takes care of all of that translating for you, so you only have to deal with one dialect,
and it's pretty simple.
